# PLUTO PAYMENTS - CARD READER
A lightweight embedded **card reader** that handles keypress instructions, provides feedback through a **16x2 LCD**, and integrates with the **RFID-RC522** module.  
This hardware implementation is part of the larger **Pluto Payments** ecosystem, which also includes a database, backend, and frontend.

## About
The project contains the following functions:
- **Real-time OS**: FreeRTOS with tasks and queue management  
- **Networking**: Wi-Fi with connect/disconnect logic  
- **User Interface**: 16x2 LCD for live feedback  
- **Input**: 4x4 keypad for device interaction  
- **Card Reader**: RFID-RC522 for secure card data reading  
- **Security**:  
  - SHA-256 hashing for sensitive values  
  - HTTPS with mutual TLS (mTLS)  
  - HMAC tokens for integrity and replay-attack protection  

## Usage

The device is **plug-and-play** once the installation guide (see below) is completed.  

1. Power on the device.  
2. Wait for the LCD screen to clear after connecting to Wi-Fi.  
3. Press any key on the **4x4 keypad** to wake the device.  
   - **A** â†’ Start a payment  
   - **C** â†’ Put device back to sleep  

> **Note:** The **C key** always acts as a *cancel button* throughout the entire program.

### Creating a Payment

1. **Enter Amount**  
   - Input the amount (supports up to 2 decimal places).
   - Use **\*** to enter a decimal  
   - Use **D** to delete the last entered character.  
   - Press **A** to confirm the amount.  

2. **Scan Card**  
   - Present the card to the **RFID-RC522 reader**.  

3. **Enter PIN Code**  
   - PIN must be exactly **4 digits**.  
   - Use **D** to delete the last entry.  
   - Press **A** to confirm.  

4. **Send Payment Request**  
   - The device creates an **HTTPS request** over **mTLS**.  
   - Request includes **HMAC tokens** for integrity protection.  
   - The LCD will show feedback from the server response.  

   ðŸ”§ If you want to disable LCD response feedback, you can modify the function in [`https_implementation.c`](main/src/https_implementation.c):  

   ```c
   esp_err_t https_create_and_send_request(char *request_body, char *hmac, char *out, size_t out_size)
   ```

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to be able to build the project:

#### ESP-IDF
The Espressif IoT Development Framework. This project was build with version 5.4.1.

### Drivers
Some of the peripheral drivers are included in the component folder as submodules. Follow the setup guide in detail to correctly download them aswell.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the project
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lafftale1999/pluto_payments_hardware.git
```

### 2. Configure files

#### 2.1. project_config.h
This file is found here [components/project_config/project_config.h](components/project_config/project_config.h). Here you set the settings for the keypad, spi and i2c communication.

```c
#ifndef _PROJECT_CONFIG_H
#define _PROJECT_CONFIG_H


// SET UP FOR I2C COMMUNICATION. USED FOR THE LCD 16X2 SCREEN.
#define I2C_MASTER_SCL_IO           GPIO_NUM_22                  /*!< GPIO number used for I2C master clock */
#define I2C_MASTER_SDA_IO           GPIO_NUM_21                  /*!< GPIO number used for I2C master data  */
#define I2C_MASTER_NUM              I2C_NUM_0                   /*!< I2C port number for master dev */
#define I2C_MASTER_FREQ_HZ          100000                      /*!< I2C master clock frequency */
#define I2C_MASTER_TX_BUF_DISABLE   0                           /*!< I2C master doesn't need buffer */
#define I2C_MASTER_RX_BUF_DISABLE   0                           /*!< I2C master doesn't need buffer */
#define I2C_MASTER_TIMEOUT_MS       1000
#define I2C_DEVICE_ADDRESS_LEN      I2C_ADDR_BIT_LEN_7

// SET UP FOR SPI COMMUNICATION. USED FOR THE RFIC-RC522
#define RC522_SPI_BUS_GPIO_MISO    GPIO_NUM_19
#define RC522_SPI_BUS_GPIO_MOSI    GPIO_NUM_23
#define RC522_SPI_BUS_GPIO_SCLK    GPIO_NUM_18
#define RC522_SPI_SCANNER_GPIO_SDA GPIO_NUM_5
#define RC522_SCANNER_GPIO_RST     (-1) // soft-reset

// COLUMN AND ROW PINS USED FOR THE KEYPAD LOGIC
#define KEYPAD_ROW_PINS {GPIO_NUM_26, GPIO_NUM_25, GPIO_NUM_17, GPIO_NUM_16}
#define KEYPAD_COL_PINS {GPIO_NUM_27, GPIO_NUM_14, GPIO_NUM_12, GPIO_NUM_13}

#endif
```

#### 2.2. credentials.h
Create this file in [main/include/](main/include/)-directory and set up your credentials for both wifi, device key (used for hmac) and api end-points.

```c
#ifndef SECRET_CREDENTIALS_H
#define SECRET_CREDENTIALS_H

#define WIFI_SSID   "admin"
#define WIFI_PASS   "admin123"

#define DEVICE_KEY  "secret_key"

#define SERVER_HOST         "192.168.0.100"
#define PLUTO_URL           "https://192.168.0.100:443"
#define PLUTO_PAYMENT_API   "/device/authorize"

#endif
```

#### 2.3. Certificates and keys
For this solution you need the following:
* `client-cert.pem`
* `client-key.pem`
* `ca-cert.pem`

> **Note:** The client key and cert need to be signed by the same CA as `ca-cert.pem`. The server receiving the certificates also need to have it's own certificates (often keystore) signed by the same CA.

## From the Author

Working on this project has been an incredibly rewarding journey.  
It has challenged me to dive deeper into embedded systems development and apply concepts that I have little to no earlier experience with.

Some of the key takeaways for me have been:  
- Gaining practical experience with the **producer/consumer pattern** using FreeRTOS.  
- Building a stronger understanding of **opaque pointers** and why they matter in clean, maintainable C code.  
- Applying **secure communication practices** (mTLS, HMAC, SHA-256) in a real-world scenario.  
- Bridging the gap between **hardware integration** (RFID, LCD, keypad) and **networked systems**.  

It hasnâ€™t always been easyâ€”there were plenty of moments of trial and errorâ€”but each obstacle brought valuable insights into both **embedded development** and **software engineering best practices**.  

I believe projects like this show the importance of hands-on exploration beyond whatâ€™s covered in the curriculum.
